<h5>
Hi there. My name is Patrick and I'm currently enrolled in the Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp program. 
It's intense, with a lot to learn while also working full-time. Speaking of, I'm a financial analyst and have been in 
my position for over six years now.
<br>
Outside of work and school, I enjoy music, movies, and traveling. Often times I travel to see certain shows. I also
have a few friends who are always down to check out any new movie, regardless of the genre. Woot woot.
